    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Rahima — I’m 17 and I love getting lost in stories. For me, TV shows and films are windows into other worlds and mirrors of our own lives. Whether it’s a sharp mystery, an emotional drama, or a wild comedy, I love unpacking what makes them so special. Here you’ll find my essays and thoughts about the shows and movies I can’t stop thinking about. As said in high fidelity ( i don't discriminate between the show and the film ;)) "I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like… Books, records, films – these things matter. Call me shallow but it’s the fuckin’ truth" but then the book did say “It's not what you like but what you are like that's important.” so take that as you will!!
I've changed my mind on what this website is. These are just my thoughts on everything this is my world wide web </p>
    <p>Take a look around — and maybe you’ll see your favorite characters in a new way too!</p>
