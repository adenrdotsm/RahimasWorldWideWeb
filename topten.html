        <h3>Violent Things</h3>
        <p class="artist">The Brobecks</p>
        <p class="description">A chaotic little indie-pop gem. It feels like a teenage fever dream — dramatic, cinematic, and self-aware in the best way
.The Brobecks’ sound is characterized by an engaging interplay between upbeat synth-driven melodies and gritty, distorted guitar riffs, creating a dynamic contrast that energizes their tracks. The synth keyboards often provide bright, melodic hooks and rhythmic accents, which contrast yet mesh seamlessly with the grungy, overdriven guitars and punchy drum patterns. Their arrangements frequently shift between tight, punchy sections and more expansive, atmospheric moments, showcasing layered textures and nuanced dynamics. Vocally, the delivery ranges from emotive crooning to sardonic bursts, supported by tight harmonies and occasional vocal distortion that enhance the raw, emotive quality of their music. The production often embraces a lo-fi aesthetic, lending an intimate, garage-band feel while maintaining clarity in instrument separation. Dallon’s voice sounds like he's smiling through heartbreak.
I first discove4red this album through spotify. It was the first album where i listened to it the whole way through- when i was 14 i would just listen to songs aand i didnt appreciate whole albums. the song choke by idkhow was the gateway to my first favourite album- idkhow is a duo fronted by dallon weekes the singer of the brobecks. everysong from this album has a special place in my heart. from the heartwarming melodies of love at first sight to the cynical and existential reflection on the monotony of life every song is as captivating as the next. Especially if you're up for a little emo! let's dive into the opener that is 'if you like it or not' as the opening track, “If You Like It or Not” sets a tone of passionate honesty and emotional complexity. The song explores the idea of a couple who are truly meant for each other — a “match made in heaven” — despite the inevitable ups and downs they face. The energetic instrumentation and dynamic rhythm reflect the push and pull of their relationship, capturing both the excitement and the struggles involved. Listening to it feels like being caught in the whirlwind of love: intense, sometimes messy, but undeniably real. The lyrics convey a deep commitment and acceptance, highlighting that love isn’t always perfect, but it’s worth fighting for if you like it or not.</p>

        <h3>When the Pawn...</h3>
        <p class="artist">Fiona Apple</p>
        <p class="description">Raw, poetic, and unpredictable. Fiona writes like she's whispering secrets you weren't meant to hear. This album makes anger sound like a symphony.
 I started listening to fiona apple in october of 2024 yet she made it to sixth on my top ten most listened to artists of the year and i listen to A LOT of music and if that doesnt say something about the spell that her music casts im not sure what can.

 Fiona Apple’s sound is defined by intricate piano-driven arrangements layered with unconventional time signatures and complex rhythmic patterns that challenge traditional pop structures. Her piano playing alternates between sparse, haunting chords and dense, percussive runs, providing both melodic foundation and dynamic tension. The production often uses warm, organic instrumentation—like upright bass, brushed drums, and subtle string arrangements—that complement her deeply expressive and nuanced vocal delivery. Her voice shifts effortlessly between raw vulnerability and powerful intensity, employing wide dynamic ranges, vocal runs, and deliberate phrasing that emphasize emotional storytelling. Apple’s use of dissonance, unexpected chord progressions, and dramatic pauses creates an atmosphere of introspection and tension, inviting listeners into a deeply personal and sometimes theatrical sonic space. from the fierce mix of anger and aching longing, with fiona's voice raw and urgent- like shes wrestling with deep, jarring emotions that won't leave her the album keeps this tone as it continues but gradually gets softer and more jazzy.

 For example take (in my opinion) the climax of the album 'paper bag' despite its introspective and somewhat melancholic lyrics paper bag has a suprisingly upbeat and bright sound. The jazzy piano rhythms and syncopated drums give the track a bouncy, lighthearted feel, while Fiona’s expressive vocals add warmth and a playful edge. This contrast between the lively instrumentation and the emotional depth creates a bittersweet mood — like finding a glimmer of hope amid confusion and sadness. Finally the closer of the album “I Know” carries a tragic softness that feels like a quiet, aching confession. Fiona's mousy and restrained vocals pierce through your heart as if she is confessing directly to if not through your mind, body, and soul. The delicate piano and subtle string arrangements wrap around Fiona’s voice, which is gentle yet heavy with sorrow. The slow, tender melody creates an intimate space where vulnerability and heartbreak blend seamlessly, making the song feel both fragile and profoundly moving.

 Although fionas music sounds and gives a completely different experience  compared to my usual taste of indie guitar rock it has an extremely big place in my library of music, it's special. </p>

        <h3>Humbug</h3>
        <p class="artist">Arctic Monkeys</p>
        <p class="description">Dark, woozy, and weird — this is their underrated masterpiece. It’s like falling asleep in a desert and dreaming of haunted carnivals. Arctic monkeys are my favourite band. I'm not going to say they are the greatest of all time but i will say they are my favourite. arctic monkeys take up a great portion of the love i have to offer fopr music- i'm not sure why that is it could be the catchy and moody composit6ion of their fast paced and heavy instruments or the lyrics that cut deep. i once heard that they have never said the sentence 'i love you' in their music and maybe that's it- the genius of their writing.
Humbug” marks a stylistic shift for Arctic Monkeys, embracing a darker, more atmospheric tone. The album’s sound is defined by heavy use of reverb-drenched guitars and layered distortion, creating a dense, textured sonic landscape. The rhythms are slower and more deliberate compared to their earlier work, with groove-oriented drum patterns that add weight and moodiness. The basslines are prominent and often melodic, weaving through the arrangements to build tension. Alex Turner’s vocals adopt a deeper, more subdued delivery, blending seamlessly with the psychedelic and desert rock influences. Effects like delay and phaser on guitars, combined with haunting keyboard pads, contribute to an eerie, immersive vibe throughout the album. humbug feels like stepping into a shadwoy, desert night ( probably the josh homme of it all) its moody, mysterious and a bit unsettling. the slow, heavy rhythms and swirlig, distorted guitars create and atmosphere thick with tension and introspection.Listening to it, I feel a restless longing, like wandering through unfamiliar terrain searching for something just out of reach.
 Alex Turner’s deeper, more subdued vocals add a layer of cool detachment, but beneath that lies a quiet vulnerability that makes the album feel intimate and raw. It’s music that invites you to get lost in its darkness, to sit with your own thoughts and uncertainties rather than run from them. lets talk about the opener of the album 'my propellerwith a slow, brooding energy that immediately signals a shift from Arctic Monkeys’ earlier, faster-paced work to something darker and more atmospheric. The song’s heavy, deliberate tempo and swirling guitar textures establish a mood of mystery and introspection. Its hypnotic rhythm and cryptic lyrics hint at themes of uncertainty, desire, and inner conflict that run throughout the album. Now for my personal favourite ' fire and the thud. It pulses with a restless energy that feels both urgent and simmering beneath the surface. The driving bassline and tight drum patterns create a steady heartbeat that propels the song forward, mirroring a sense of eagerness and anticipation. Alex Turner’s vocals carry a smoky intensity, expressing a deep longing and desire that’s both impatient and restrained. The swirling guitars and atmospheric production add layers of tension, making the song feel like a slow burn — a craving that’s just on the edge of eruption. It’s a track that perfectly captures the feeling of wanting something intensely but holding back, caught between restraint and release. and to quit with my rambling its time to talk about the wonder of a closer that is... the jewellers hands.
The Jeweller’s Hands” feels like a quiet exhale after the album’s darker, more intense moments. Its slow, languid pace and sparse instrumentation create an intimate, almost haunting atmosphere. The delicate guitar work and subtle percussion give the song a fragile beauty, while Alex Turner’s voice is tender and reflective, carrying a sense of weariness and acceptance. The lyrics feel poetic and cryptic, inviting listeners to linger in the shadows of the album’s themes — uncertainty, desire, and introspection. It’s a fitting conclusion that leaves you with a bittersweet sense of closure, as if the story has paused rather than ended.The lyrics in “The Jeweller’s Hands” are poetic, enigmatic, and layered with imagery that evokes fragility and introspection. Lines like “The jeweller’s hands don’t thrill you / But they do the job” suggest a quiet resignation—an acceptance of something imperfect but necessary. The cryptic nature of the words invites multiple interpretations, reflecting the album’s themes of uncertainty, emotional complexity, and the blurred line between desire and detachment. Turner’s lyrics often feel like whispered confessions, adding to the intimate and reflective mood of the track. Overall, the lyrics enhance the song’s sense of vulnerability and the bittersweet closure that Humbug offers as an album. ' </p>

        <h3>First Band on the Moon</h3>
        <p class="artist">The Cardigans</p>
        <p class="description">Sweet but deadly. This album lures you in with pretty melodies then guts you with quietly devastating lyrics. A soft pink dagger.
Ahh this beautiful album. As everybody else my age, i discovered the cardigans through the sudden boom of their songs 'lovefool' and 'step on me' on tiktok ( i know tiktok mention- cringe!). idk what made me listen to this album but i am eternally grateful that i did. 

First Band on the Moon is a masterclass in blending lightness with depth—an album that feels effortlessly beautiful yet richly layered. The Cardigans craft songs that float with airy melodies and smooth vocals, wrapped in lush, shimmering arrangements. The production strikes a perfect balance between pop accessibility and subtle sophistication, with gentle guitars, warm keyboards, and groovy rhythms creating an inviting, dreamy atmosphere. What makes the album truly special is how it pairs catchy hooks with introspective, sometimes melancholic lyrics—inviting listeners to both sway along and reflect. It’s an album that feels like a comforting, sunlit escape, yet with an emotional complexity that lingers long after the music fades.First Band on the Moon blends bright, jangly guitars with soft keyboards to create a warm, textured sound. Tight, syncopated drums and groovy basslines keep the rhythm steady and danceable. Nina Persson’s airy vocals are clear and often layered with subtle harmonies. The songs use major keys with occasional chord shifts, balancing upbeat melodies with a bittersweet feel. Dynamic contrasts between soft verses and lush choruses add emotional depth and keep the album engaging.

The opener of this album is one of my favourite songs by the cardigans and really sets the whole thing up- let's talk about your new cuckoo.Your New Cuckoo” opens the album with an instantly addictive, playful groove. The tight, syncopated rhythm section — especially the bass — gives the track a funky, swinging pulse, while the clean guitars and light, airy keyboards add a layer of brightness that makes it feel both retro and fresh. Nina Persson’s vocals are delivered with a cool, almost teasing tone, matching the song’s sly, ironic attitude.

Lyrically, it’s sharp and slightly cryptic, hinting at themes of change, jealousy, and playfulness in relationships — but always with a wink. The contrast between the bubbly instrumentation and the more biting lyrical edge creates tension that makes the track more than just a catchy opener. It perfectly sets the tone for the album’s mix of sweetness and bite.

and for the extremely underrated closer that is 'choke'. I love the song choke, the way the instruments build up then pause to make space for Nina Persson's beautiful vocals is absolutely stellar. “Choke” is a slow-burning, melancholic track that contrasts the more playful songs on the album with its sparse instrumentation and emotional restraint. Built around a minimal, moody arrangement, the song leans heavily on gentle electric guitar and atmospheric keyboards, creating an almost weightless, floating feeling. The tempo is slow and steady, giving the sense of time stretching out — mirroring the emotional tension in the lyrics.

Nina Persson’s vocals are delicate and mournful, nearly whispered at points, which adds intimacy and vulnerability. The lyrics are cryptic but suggest themes of control, emotional distance, and quiet suffocation — true to the title. Harmonically, it stays restrained, using subtle dissonance to create unease without ever exploding into drama. It’s a song that doesn’t plead or cry out — it lingers, unsettled and unresolved.

First Band on the Moon is a deceptively sweet, sonically polished pop album that masks emotional complexity beneath bright melodies and clean production. With its playful irony, airy vocals, and tight, jazz-tinged arrangements, The Cardigans craft a sound that feels light on the surface but lingers with melancholy and emotional sharpness. It’s an album that captures the tension between charm and detachment, between love and disillusionment — delivering bittersweet honesty in a soft, sugarcoated shell. </p>

      <div class="details">
        <h3>Belladonna of Sadness</h3>
        <p class="artist">Alexandra Savior</p>
        <p class="description">Slinky, hypnotic, and smoky with just the right amount of mystery. It feels like a black-and-white movie set in your brain. Every track feels like a spell. Before listening to the whole album, 'Bones' was my main squueze and when i listened to the whole album i was shocked at how much i enjoyed it. listening to alexandra saviour is an out of body experience, it's lana del rey and arctic monkeys whats not to like. Pitchfork says "Alexandra Savior has a penchant for clever wordplay and a voice that can hypnotize, terrorize, or both in four measures or less" and i'm mad that i couldn't say it first ( not that i could've). Saviour is the IT girl in my eyes i mean with a name like that who wouldnt want to be her.

Belladonna of Sadness is less an album than an atmosphere — thick with perfume, velvet, and candle smoke. From the first note, it sways like a dream caught between past and present. Co-produced by James Ford and Alex Turner, the album is soaked in noirish texture and psych-pop elegance, echoing everything from dusty ’60s girl groups and spaghetti western soundtracks to the sultrier sides of Nancy Sinatra, Mazzy Star, and Serge Gainsbourg. It’s cinematic but intimate — the soundtrack to a heartbreak that’s stylish even when it stings.

Technically, the production is lush but restrained. You can feel Ford’s signature control in the tight, echo-drenched percussion and warm analog tones, while Turner’s influence runs through the shadowy guitar lines and melodic sensibility, dripping with mood and mystique. The arrangements are often sparse — reverb-heavy guitar, Wurlitzer keys, and tape-hiss textures — leaving space for Savior’s voice to take center stage: breathy, haunted, seductive, aching.

Savior doesn’t just sing — she drifts. Her delivery is theatrical but never artificial, full of lingering sighs and unexpected turns. The lyrics blend vintage glamour with eerie sadness: heartbreak, longing, control, and the surreal roles women are asked to play. Even the title, Belladonna of Sadness, nods to a cult anime about feminine rage and mysticism, framing the whole record in a mythology of power and vulnerability.

There’s beauty in its decay — like a love letter written in eyeliner and wine. It doesn’t demand your attention. It casts you.

“Mirage” opens Belladonna of Sadness with restraint and confidence. It eases the listener into the album’s world with a slow, deliberate tempo and sparse but carefully placed instrumentation — a reverb-soaked guitar, light percussion, and subtle ambient textures. The production is minimal but rich, allowing each sound to breathe and linger. James Ford’s touch is evident in the clarity and control of the mix, while Alex Turner’s influence shines through in the shadowy chord progressions and cinematic pacing.
The lyrics toy with perception and identity, framing Savior as someone caught between being watched and misunderstood. The chorus — “It’s just a mirage” — repeats like a warning or a realization, underlining the theme of illusion and emotional distance. Savior’s vocal performance is intimate but guarded, full of tension; she doesn’t push, but every line carries weight. Her voice often floats just above the instrumentation, more observed than forceful, and that detachment becomes part of the song’s emotional power.
As an opener, “Mirage” doesn’t rush to impress. Instead, it sets the mood: cool, unflinching, and slightly eerie — like stepping into a story already in motion, with no clear beginning or end. It introduces not just the sonic palette of the album, but its emotional landscape too: beautiful, lonely, and constantly slipping just out of reach.

Now for one of my personal favourites- “Shades” is one of the most emotionally vulnerable tracks on Belladonna of Sadness. Where much of the album leans into stylized detachment and mystery, this song feels quieter and more exposed. Alexandra Savior sings with a softness that strips away the persona, revealing uncertainty and longing. The lyric “I can’t read your shades” captures that emotional distance she can’t quite cross.
Musically sparse and slow-burning, “Shades” lets the emotion sit close to the surface. It’s a turning point on the album — a moment where Savior stops performing and simply feels.

“Mystery Girl” perfectly encapsulates the essence of Belladonna of Sadness, closing the album with an air of mystery and emotional restraint. Rather than offering clear answers or resolution, it deepens the album’s themes of distance, allure, and ambiguity. Alexandra Savior’s cool, composed vocals and the minimal, moody instrumentation leave the listener with a lingering sense of intrigue — a final glimpse of a persona that remains beautifully elusive. In this way, the album ends not with a definitive statement, but with a stylish and haunting vanishing act, embodying the complex blend of vulnerability and mystique that defines Belladonna of Sadness as a whole

To summarise myself, this album is full of amazing songs- It draws you in. A spell with ingredients of the essence of vintage, velvet, and cigarette smoke.

      <img src="images/Colour-it-in.jpg" alt="The Maccabees - Colour It In" />
      <div class="details">
        <h3>Colour It In</h3>
        <p class="artist">The Maccabees</p>
        <p class="description">This is what joy sounds like when it’s been through something. Nostalgic, wide-eyed, and beautifully chaotic — perfect for walking home at golden hour.
The Maccabees ruled my summer of 2024, it was GCSE summer a summer of swimming, an allowance to be free from school stress and where you had to find yourself and colour it in was the perfect backdrop for this. This album is 'love' i'm not sure how else to describe it. This was my private pleasure and gave me nostalgia for a time i wasnt even alive (i was only born in 2008 unfortunately). I recently read a pitchfork review by Joshua klein on colour it in although it was critical i do think it made some good points. I can't be judged for what i next say; british 2000s guitar rock was a special interest of mine so this may not even be about what i think of the album and may just reference the scene in general. Joshua Klein says "God only know what the impact of the Libertines or the Arctic Monkeys will fully evince in the near future, but clearly the wheels are already in motion. In fact, however tangential their styles, it's hard to imagine the Maccabees existing without either of those bands as predecessors or peers, not to mention even more likeminded acts such as Bloc Party or the Futureheads (fellow rediscoverers of the Gang of Four and XTC). In fact, even though the Maccabees have been humping it out for a few years now, the group's debut Colour It In sounds so banally of-the-now that it beggars the imagination." I would love to know what his thoughts are now and what he thought the influence created but unfortunately i dont know a joshua klein and plus i'd probably be a little mad because of his review... This album has been dubbed a early-twenties crisis album and although yeah i've got 4/3 more years til i can 'relate' i felt the ennui and struggle for identity that summer i was bored off my mind and i just wanted to party. this album had a song for everyhting i felt.
Colour It In feels like a snapshot of a very specific kind of youth: restless, hopeful, heart-on-sleeve, and always a little unsure. It’s bursting with nervous energy — jittery guitar lines, quick-shifting rhythms, and lyrics that are both romantic and mundane, as if documenting ordinary moments through a lens of deep emotional significance.

Technically, the album leans into sharp, angular guitar work, clean melodic hooks, and tight, stop-start rhythms — a post-punk and indie pop hybrid with clear ties to early Bloc Party and Mystery Jets. But what sets it apart is its emotional clarity. There’s no posturing here. Even in its most chaotic moments, there’s something gentle and genuine in Orlando Weeks’ vocal delivery — breathless, stammering, full of unfiltered longing.

Tracks like “First Love” and “Toothpaste Kisses” feel like different sides of the same coin — one jittery and immediate, the other tender and stripped-back. The album moves between excitement and introspection with ease, never losing its sense of sincerity.

Colour It In isn’t just about being young — it feels young. It captures that tension between wanting to grow up and not wanting to lose the simplicity of what you already have. Messy, sweet, and full of motion, it’s a debut that doesn’t just announce a band — it opens a window into an entire emotional world.

“Good Old Bill” anchors Colour It In in something deeper than the usual stories of young love and nervous nights out. It introduces the album not with romance or restlessness, but with grief — a personal, grounding moment that subtly shapes everything that follows. Without directly referencing death again, the album carries a kind of emotional openness, a willingness to feel things fully, whether it’s the ache of first love or the sting of nostalgia. That honesty — messy, scattered, sincere — is the through-line. It’s not a coming-of-age record in the traditional sense; it’s a record about experiencing youth while already feeling its impermanence.

Where “Good Old Bill” is jittery and unresolved, “Toothpaste Kisses” is calm and tender — a quiet sigh at the end of all the noise. It doesn’t strive for a dramatic finale; instead, it leans into gentleness, like the hush after a long, chaotic day. With its stripped-back guitar, soft whistling, and minimal arrangement, the track feels almost weightless. Orlando Weeks’ voice, fragile and unguarded, carries the whole song in a tone that’s both intimate and slightly uncertain — like he’s trying to preserve something fleeting.

There’s no attempt at closure here, just a small, affectionate moment preserved in sound. It’s romantic, yes, but not idealised — it’s real, warm, and full of hesitation. As the final track, it doesn’t answer any of the questions the album raises. It simply sits with them, offering the listener a moment of stillness. It mirrors how memory often works: not with clarity or resolution, but with the sensation of having felt something deeply.

Together, the opener and closer quietly map out the album’s emotional territory — not from wild highs to lows, but from grief to grace. In doing so, Colour It In reveals its true gift: capturing life’s smallest moments with startling sincerity.

      <img src="images/grace.jpg" alt="Jeff Buckley - Grace" />
      <div class="details">
        <h3>Grace</h3>
        <p class="artist">Jeff Buckley</p>
        <p class="description">An emotional gut-punch. Jeff sings like he's channeling something bigger than himself — romantic, tortured, divine. Buckleyisunmatched. Oh how i love Jeff Buckley, i would curse the missispi river for him. This album is simply just gut-wrenching. Although not every song on this album is a favourite of mine ( cough, cough corpus christi carol) i think i should be arrested if this wasnt on my list. Grace is an absolute fucking classic plus jeff was a god on guitar i still struggle to play his songs. Grace shows how diverse and flexible jeff was in his ability to make music- he was a musical God and although i may not listen to alot of his music (it bums me out too much) i can still recognise why grace is a pillar in the world of music. In my opinion Grace has a legacy like no other.

Jeff Buckley felt like someone from another planet — the kind of artist who didn’t just make music, he sort of was music. There’s this ghostly quality to him, like he was never fully here. You can tell he was someone who felt everything too deeply, and instead of hiding that, he poured it into every note. He wasn’t trying to be a rock star or fit into a scene — he was just following whatever wild, beautiful thing was happening in his head and heart. That’s why his music feels so personal and untouchable. There’s something tragic about how little he recorded before he died, but also something kind of perfect about it too — like he gave us this one shimmering album and then vanished, leaving behind this impossible, emotional masterpiece that still doesn’t sound like anything else.

Jeff Buckley’s Grace is ridiculous in the best way — it’s messy, dramatic, tender, and completely overwhelming, like someone feeling everything all at once and refusing to tone it down. His voice is the first thing that hits you: delicate one second, wailing the next, but always raw and intentional, like he’s not just singing, he’s spilling. The guitar work is dreamy and strange — watery, echoing, a little off-kilter — and it makes everything feel like it’s floating and falling apart at the same time. What I love most is how unafraid it is to be too much — the album builds and crumbles constantly, but it never feels fake or theatrical. It’s just honest. Even when the songs get loud and chaotic, there’s always something fragile at the center, like he’s barely holding it together. Grace doesn’t really follow rules — it just feels, and that’s what makes it so special. It’s not just music you hear, it’s music that sort of drags you into its world and leaves you breathless by the end.

“Mojo Pin” opens Grace like a dream slipping into a nightmare. It starts soft — ambient guitar textures, almost like a lullaby — but quickly unravels into something desperate and chaotic. The time signature shifts feel unstable, and Jeff’s voice stretches from delicate falsetto to full-body wails. Harmonically, it leans into dissonance — those eerie chord changes never quite resolve, which makes everything feel tense and unpredictable. 
It’s a song about obsession, craving, and losing control, and the way it builds — slow, haunting, then explosive — mirrors that perfectly.the tone is so fitting, mojo pin is a song about a dream, a dream of a woman so beautiful that "the whole universe tells you that you have to have her, you start watching her favorite TV shows all night, you start buying her the things she needs, you start drinking her drinks, you start smoking her bad cigarettes, you start picking up her nuances in her voice, you sleep in safe sometimes the most dangerous thing... this is called mojo pin"
i mean you can see why the guy is an absolute icon what a description. A mojo pin was buckley's nickname for a syringe of heroin i mean it's weird this doesnt even through me off some great songs are about heroin- 
Golden brown by the stranglers,
 heroin by lou reed/ the velvet underground,
and beetlebum by blur 
but thisss song isnt aabout heroin its about a dream of love so addictive that it feels like pure bliss -it can ravage you and waking up is like a come down so heartbreaking this is expressed by the first two lines of the chorus 'don't wanna weep for you, dont want to know i'm blind and tortured' the music changes from slow to heavy and fast paced representing the anger he feel at this intense switch of experiencing love to being in complete absence of it ( or who knows the song could just be about heroin and im just an egg). now lets move from mojo pin where im just rambling to the absolute treasure that is grace.

"Grace" doesn’t ease you in — it sweeps you off your feet. The opening riff has this dark elegance, like it knows something you don’t. Then Jeff’s voice comes in, and it’s not just singing — it’s pleading, glowing, unraveling. There’s a weight to it, but it never drags; it floats just above the ground, like it's not quite human.
The song is about love and death tangled up together — knowing you’re going to lose someone, and still choosing to love them anyway. It’s romantic, but in that painful, too-honest way. His lyrics feel like pages torn from a diary you’re not supposed to read.
Musically, it shifts in ways that don’t feel predictable. The verses are gentle, nearly whispered, then the chorus crashes in with so much intensity it’s almost too much — but never messy. The whole thing feels designed to knock the air out of you without ever yelling.
" Jeff wrote lyrics inspired by his saying goodbye to his girlfriend at the airport on a rainy day, and the vocal melody came naturally. In Buckley’s words, “It’s about not feeling so bad about your own mortality when you have true love.”" Grace confuses me, i mean i absolutely love it and think its a beautiful song but i dont understand it- and i dont thi8nk its for me to understand, im just hear to appreciate and be thankful that my ears can be blessed by this and hope that maybe one day i  can be enlightened as to what it means.

Now im confused on what i should use to talk about the closer the gut-wrenching track 'dream brother' was originally graces final track instead of 'forget her' which was added in 2004 when the legacy album came out i love both of these songs but dream brother takes the cake man, that song is tragic.

It creeps in like a warning disguised as a lullaby. The rhythm sways — kind of hypnotic, almost like it’s rocking you to sleep — but there’s something sharp underneath. It’s one of the eeriest songs on Grace, both musically and emotionally. Jeff’s voice is quieter here, but more haunted. He sings like he’s watching someone make the same mistake he’s seen before — and this time, he can’t stop it.
The lyrics are pointed but poetic: “Don’t be like the one who made me so old.” It’s a message to his friend (and maybe to himself), begging him not to abandon someone the way Jeff’s own father did. It’s layered — personal, biblical, even a little ghostly. The whole song feels soaked in warning and sadness.
There’s this weightless tension in the instrumentation — the guitar and bass drift just out of sync, and the drums hit soft but heavy, like they’re holding back something bigger. It all builds in waves until the final stretch, when Jeff lets loose one last aching falsetto, like a final breath before the album closes.
 
Dream Brother is Jeff Buckley’s final statement on Grace, and one of the most personal. The song was written as a message to his close friend and bandmate Chris Dowd, who was considering leaving his pregnant girlfriend. Jeff, haunted by the absence of his own father (folk musician Tim Buckley), wrote the song as a kind of plea: don’t repeat the cycle that hurt me.
The lyrics carry a sense of generational trauma, love, and deep moral urgency. Lines like “Don’t be like the one who made me so old / Don’t be like the one who left behind his name” are direct references to Tim, who Jeff barely knew and who died of a heroin overdose at 28. Jeff’s fatherhood wound bleeds through every line — this isn’t just advice to a friend; it’s him begging the past not to repeat itself.
There’s also a spiritual and surreal tone — phrases like “asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over” and “light in your head and a feather in your bed” make the song feel like a fever dream. It slips between warning and prophecy, love and fury. Even the title — “Dream Brother” — suggests a bond that exists more in feeling than in blood.
In the context of Grace, this song closes the album on something unresolved. It doesn’t give peace — it just leaves you sitting with all the sadness, beauty, and damage that came before it.

Gia deitch say "Grace takes the listener on a turbulent journey, primarily detailing the trials and tribulations of love and heartbreak." and i think that is a perfect way to end this ramble.

        <h3>Coastal Grooves<h3>
        <p class="artist">Blood Orange</p>
        <p class="description">Dev Hynes’ Coastal Grooves is this incredible mix of smooth R&B, dreamy synths, and indie vibes that feels both fresh and nostalgic at the same time. The production is super rich—there’s this cool blend of hazy guitars, soft synth layers, and laid-back beats that pull you in without overwhelming. His voice is relaxed but emotional, giving the songs this intimate, almost confessional feeling. Lyrically, the album explores identity, love, and vulnerability in a way that’s subtle but really powerful. It’s the kind of album you want to listen to when you’re winding down but still thinking deeply about everything.
Okay so everyone knows the song champagne coast the heartbreaking vocals that encapsulate a feeling of loss it really blew up on tiktok a while back so much so that my 11 year old sister listens to it- but guess what- i didnt like it, i know shock horror how the fuck is this song the closer of one of your beloved albums. But i do like the song...I think i was just trying to be different aned probably had some resentment to it cause if i liked it that wouldve meant that my kpop enjoying sister and i had music in common ( nothing against kpop im not a snob its just not my thing.. probably cause my sister likes it so much ). But one day i was doing my makeup to see what i'd look like on my birthday and i put champagne coast on, i was like okay this is good then i put the album on. Forget it came one and i swear down i actually ascended to the heavens at that moment, it was like nothing i'd experienced before, but then the bangers just started coming on'a complete knock' then 'are you sure you're really busy' my ears and brain where giving tens across the board. Then that album was on loop for months.

One of the defining features of Coastal Grooves is its plucky guitar work. These guitar lines are often clean and crisp, with a bright, staccato quality that adds a rhythmic sparkle throughout the tracks. Rather than dominating the mix, they weave in and out, creating a subtle but essential texture that keeps the songs feeling dynamic and alive.
Dev Hynes’ vocals are another standout—soft, dreamy, and layered with harmonies that feel intimate and almost whispered at times. His voice often drifts over the instruments, creating an ethereal atmosphere that perfectly matches the album’s introspective mood. The vocal production uses gentle reverb and delay effects to give his singing a spacious, floating quality without losing the emotional clarity.
The drums rely heavily on crisp hi-hat patterns, which provide a steady, shimmering rhythm that propels the songs forward. These hi-hats are usually tight and precise, giving the tracks a laid-back groove that never feels too busy or overproduced. Alongside the hi-hats, the beats often mix electronic percussion with subtle organic drum sounds, creating a cool balance between programmed and live-feel rhythms.
Together, these elements—the plucky guitars, dreamy vocals, and hi-hat-driven drums—form the core of Coastal Grooves’ unique sound. They create a smooth, hypnotic flow that feels both intimate and expansive, making the album perfect for late-night listening or moments of quiet reflection.

One of the most distinctive and vibrant influences on Coastal Grooves is the unmistakable energy and aesthetic of 1980s queer club culture, especially the world of drag queens. Dev Hynes has openly talked about how this scene shaped the album’s sound and mood, embracing its theatricality, boldness, and emotional complexity.

The lush synths, shimmering guitars, and glossy production often feel like a sonic homage to the glamorous, extravagant vibes of ’80s nightlife—where drag queens reigned as icons of self-expression and defiance. The album captures that spirit of performance and identity play, but also layers it with genuine vulnerability and introspection.

In an interview, Dev said:

“I grew up fascinated by the drag scene and how those performers created these larger-than-life characters while also sharing their real stories. That tension between fantasy and truth really inspired the emotional tone of Coastal Grooves.”

He also reflected on the influence of ’80s club music:

“There’s this energy in ’80s dance and pop that’s so alive and liberating. I wanted to channel that feeling—like being in a space where you can be whoever you want, but also confront what’s really inside.”

This blend of glamour and raw honesty runs through the album, giving it a unique place where theatrical style meets sincere storytelling. It’s a celebration of queer history and identity wrapped in dreamy, hypnotic soundscapes that feel both nostalgic and fresh.

anyways lets talk about the wonder that is fukcing 'forget it' by blood orange. Whats not to like about this song at first, “Forget It” feels breezy and upbeat — the hi-hats tick over like a laid-back rhythm, and the plucky guitar riffs shimmer gently, setting a mellow, late-night vibe. But beneath that smooth surface, there’s an unmistakable ache.
Dev Hynes’s vocals are calm and steady, masking pain behind a veneer of cool. When he sings,

“I am not your savior, baby girl,”
it’s not delivered with pride or defiance—it’s admission. A gentle pullback, accepting distance, even as he acknowledges its sting. Then comes the outro: “hurry,” whispered again and again, as if the moment’s weight finally breaches his composure.
The technical setup of the track mirrors this emotional trajectory. The bright guitar plucks sit lightly atop shimmering synths and grounded bass, creating a sense of movement and calm. Crisp hi-hats drive the rhythm, keeping the groove alive without overpowering the emotional core. Each instrument makes room for the next, echoing the song’s theme: presence and loss coexisting in the same space.
Lyrically, the song captures that slow emotional drift in the aftermath of connection. There’s no dramatic confrontation—just the soft realization that someone has already gone. The gentle production and Dev’s restrained delivery make every word feel intimate, every pause intentional. It’s heartbreak without the fireworks—just a steady unraveling.
In essence, “Forget It” is a study in contrast: upbeat melody, somber message; controlled delivery, shattered core. That duality—of groove and grief—is what makes the song quietly unforgettable.

Blood Orange’s “Forget It” explores the tension between emotional expectation and the quiet boundary that life draws. At its heart, the song is about the limits of connection: how you can care for someone deeply, but still realize you can’t save them.

“I am not your savior, baby girl” is a powerful refrain that echoes throughout the song. It’s not bravado—it’s self-awareness. It shows an acceptance of personal limitations and emotional honesty in a relationship 
The outro repetition of “hurry” feels like a whispered pressure—suggesting emotional urgency and the quiet pain of time slipping away, buried under composure
Behind the detached tone and minimalist groove lies a haunting loneliness. The narrator admits to feeling incomplete—“I’m incomplete… I am so lonely”—highlighting how connection often feels insufficient, even when it’s real 
Thus, “Forget It” becomes a song about emotional fatigue: wanting to matter, wanting to help, yet recognizing your limits. It’s not melodrama. It’s gentle heartbreak wrapped in cool restraint. The music matches that feeling perfectly—upbeat on the surface, but quietly unraveling underneath.

Now for 'the complete knock' it's got a beautiful intro with a muted guitar and some sort of bell..? that just immediately pulls me in and it just really speaks to me cause i actually dont know whats wrong with everyone, it reminds me that you can never know what someone is thinking which can sound a little depressing but i've go an internal locus of control which isnt really relevant i just wanted to shoiw off my knowledge of psych.I don’t even fully know why I love this song so much — it just gets into my head. Everything about it feels kind of blurry and low to the ground, like walking home too late with headphones on. The guitars are all warped and fuzzy, the vocals are super quiet, like Dev’s singing from another room. It’s messy in a really intentional way.

It sort of sounds like someone who's tired of feeling things but can’t help it. There’s this sense of being emotionally drained, like you’ve been hit too many times to react anymore — maybe that’s what “The Complete Knock” means. It’s not loud or dramatic, but it sticks with you. It’s the kind of song that says a lot by not trying to say too much. 

“Champagne Coast” feels like the perfect way to close Coastal Grooves — it’s like the soundtrack to watching the sun set after a long day, all warm colors and soft light. The song drifts slowly, with smooth, shimmering synths that create a dreamy, almost hypnotic atmosphere. The bassline is deep and steady, gently pushing the song forward without ever rushing, while subtle percussion taps in the background, like distant footsteps or a quiet heartbeat.

Dev Hynes’s voice is soft and tender here — almost like he’s whispering a secret. The way he stretches out the words gives the song a feeling of intimacy and reflection, like he’s thinking about everything that’s come before and what’s still to come. The lyrics touch on themes of escape and longing, but there’s also this bittersweet acceptance, as if he’s made peace with the past even though it still lingers.

Technically, the song uses space and texture really well — it’s sparse but never empty. The layers of synths and gentle guitars weave in and out, creating a lush soundscape that’s both calming and emotionally rich. It’s like the musical version of breathing out after holding your breath for a long time.

Overall, “Champagne Coast” is a beautiful, reflective closer that perfectly captures the mood of the whole album — dreamy, a little sad, but full of quiet hope.( i dont know how on earth i couldvve hated this song...)
