    <p><strong>Intro:</strong> In Neptune, California, everyone has secrets — and Veronica Mars makes it her business to find them out. This show is one of my all-time favorites because it mixes teenage drama, clever mysteries, and a tough but relatable heroine who never backs down.</p>

    <p><strong>Why I love it:</strong> Veronica herself is the biggest reason. She’s witty, brave, and flawed in all the best ways. I love the way each season builds a bigger mystery but still gives us little cases to solve along the way. It’s smart, funny, sometimes heartbreaking, and it says a lot about power, money, and trust.</p>

    <p><strong>Final thought:</strong> If you haven’t watched it yet, do yourself a favor — grab some popcorn and follow Veronica down the rabbit hole. Just remember: in Neptune, trust no one.</p>
