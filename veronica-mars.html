    <p><strong>rant</strong> In Neptune, California, everyone has secrets — and Veronica Mars makes it her business to find them out. I'm not one to hate on a good and trashy tv show, I know veronica mars isnt the best show in the world; its a teen drama with a sarcstic main character w've no doubt seen before. But something about Vmars is different. It can be dark and heavy sometimes but  it's sweet and just a relief to watch. Veronica mars had great potential; unfortunately iy has been lost to the times (seriously though they had a bloc party song in the first season and a dandy warhols intro- isnt that the campest thing ever)</p>

    <p><strong>time to dive into NEPTUNE. No don't be silly no the planet...</strong> Neptune is the fictional sun soaked, beach version of a noir LA that veronica mars takes place in. It's not just a backdrop, it shapes everything: the plots, themes and even our heroine herself. Neptunes never meant to be idyllic- it's a town where the lines between the rich and the poor, law and crime, secrets and truths are razor thin. Neptune is sharply divided into the wealthy elite and everyone else, it's an extreme- the show creator himself, Rob Thomas describes it as a " town without a middle class". The '09ers (the rich) refers to the zip code of the rich neighbourhood (obvioulsy a nod to the 90210 of the beverly hills. The sherrifs's department is corrupted, people with power buy silence and manipulate the truth. Neptune high is a mirror of the town the popular kids bully, lie and cover for each other whilst outsiders like veronica are relentlessly berated. Veronica and her father Keith mars run Mars Investigations, a tiny PI office that symbolises resistance against the town's corruption. Veronica takes cases for classmates who can't trust the adults. She moves between social worlds- she may be able to talk to the rich kids but she may never be one again. The darkness of the sunny town makes veronica tougher sharper and more skeptical.Like the sea God Neptune inherited it's name from, the town has secrets lurking beneath a beautiful surface. It's all sunny beaches and ocean views but nope its true character is a sinster entity. Hence, this being the perfect setting for a teen noir detective! Neptune isn’t just a backdrop — it explains Veronica. Her distrust, her cynicism, her need to seek truth. The town is a metaphor for growing up: you learn pretty beaches hide sharks.
It makes Veronica Mars timeless: no matter the era, there’s always a Neptune somewhere — a place where secrets fester and someone brave enough has to dig them up. 

 <p><strong>THE CHARACTERS!</strong>

Veronica Mars herself- the titular heroine.



    <p><strong>Let's get into why i'm so obssesed with a tv show that came out four years before i was born and cancelled when i was -2:</strong> Veronica herself is the biggest reason. She’s witty, brave, and flawed in all the best ways. I love the way each season builds a bigger mystery but still gives us little cases to solve along the way. It’s smart, funny, sometimes heartbreaking, and it says a lot about power, money, and trust.</p>

    <p><strong>Final thought:</strong> If you haven’t watched it yet, do yourself a favor — grab some popcorn and follow Veronica down the rabbit hole. Just remember: in Neptune, trust no one.</p>
